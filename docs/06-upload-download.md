\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{resources/images/06-upload-download_files/figure-latex//1BQxrVYdKZTbpCaF-i_q9w7s9x034lEXpQZDU-Sl09cs_gff2211b72f_1_252} \end{center}

Exchanging files with the cluster is very important. You can imagine scenarios where:

- You want to download log files or output files
- You want to upload a custom `.sh` script file that you wrote on your laptop
- You want to upload other files

In this course, upload and download of files is performed using [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/){target="_blank"}. Cyberduck is a tool that lets us connect to the cluster securely, browse files, and transfer files securely.

<div class = "warning">
If you are working with sensitive data (such as data with [PHI](https://www.hhs.gov/answers/hipaa/what-is-phi/index.html){target="_blank"} that requires [HIPAA compliance](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/index.html){target="_blank"}, you need to be extra cautious about transferring your data to the cluster. Your home directory is not an appropriate storage option for such data. Make sure you consider any stipulations in your data use agreements.

<div class = "notice">
The job numbers included in log file names generally increase in number. The greater the number, the more recently the job was run.
</div>

Use the `cat` command to inspect the log. Make sure you replace `[your-number-here]` to match your file. The message should show the new text that you added!
